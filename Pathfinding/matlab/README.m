%% Function descriptions
%% To view a map, given a map file

viewmap('maps/map_1.txt',0); % shows walls
viewmap('maps/map_1.txt',1); % shows track

%or else

[m]=map_convert('maps/map_1.txt');
plotmap(m);
%Here   'm' is the map file returned as a matrix
[rows, cols] = size(m);
%startloc = get_random_location(rows, cols, m);
%targetloc = get_random_location(rows, cols, m);

% Your simulations will use this structure

startLocDemo1 = [13, 0];
targetLocDemo1 = [0, 17];

[m,v,s]=dfs('maps/map_demo.txt',[13,0],[0,17]);
%[m,v,s]=dijkstra('maps/map_demo.txt',startLocDemo1,targetLocDemo1);
%[m,v,s]=astar('maps/map_demo.txt',[startloc],[targetloc]);


%Here   'm' is the map file returned as a matrix
%       'v' is a matrix that shows which cells have been visited, '0' means
%       visited, '1' means not visited
%       's' is the vector of steps to reach the target,
%       [startloc] is a vector i.e. [2,2]
%       [targetloc] is also a vector ie [4,18]

%To view the path determined above use 
plotmap(m,s);
